  In college, I was a part of Engineers without Borders, which 'builds a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs'. With my college's EWB chapter, I traveled to Morocco twice to work on engineering projects. The first time I went as a team member to help finish a bridge as a logistics lead. The second time I went as a team leader to lay the foundation for a piping system. We prepared throughout entire semesters for these trips. In these trips, I was able to apply skills acquired in the military in order to work on a team and make a real difference in people's lives.

  I have a large background in martial arts and dance, including classical ballet. Animation, and specifically the utilization of motion capture and how artists can plus that data through the pipeline is probably one of my favorite aspects of vfx. One of the corresponding videos that inspired me the most in college is seeing Benedict Cumberbatch act in a mocap suit for Smaug in The Hobbit. His performance couldn't be transposed onto Smaug's rig, but the animators still used that data as inspiration for their work.

Please note: Due to how busy I've been with Frozen 2 crunch time, I haven't had the opportunity to read any technical articles as of late. Apologies!
